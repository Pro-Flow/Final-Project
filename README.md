Final-Project
=============

For our final project, we are creating a modern, aesthetically pleasing version of air-hockey. The classic arcade game will feature new additions, like walls that light up whenever the puck or mallet hits it, an obstacle that will make the game more challenging, a sleeker design, and on-screen scoreboards. Once either player initiates the game by clicking a start button, the puck will begin in the middle. The two players will utilize the W A S D keys and the arrow keys to move their mallet. Once one player scores, the puck will go back to the middle. Once either player has reached some designated score, the game will end.
