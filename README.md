Final-Project
=============

This modern, aesthetically pleasing version of air-hockey features new additions, like brightly colored walls, a sleeker design, and on-screen scoreboards. Once either player initiates the game by clicking a start button, the puck will begin in the middle. The two players will utilize the W A S D keys and the arrow keys to move their mallet. Once one player scores, the puck will go back to the middle. Once either player has reached some designated score, the game will end. The user will then have the option to reset the game without closing the window, by clicking within a button. There will also be the option of exiting and closing the window by clicking on another button.
